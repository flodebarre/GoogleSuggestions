title: "Are Google Suggestions Sexist?"

Google's autocomplete feature sometimes yields disturbing results. When looking for female scientists, you may have noticed the appearance of "husband" in the list of suggestions, as reported recently [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pollyp1/status/733636162263351296). But does this only happen to female scientists, or instead to any public figure?

To answer this question, I gathered names of people with different professions (scientists, tennis players, Hollywood actors), wrote a script to fetch the list of Google suggestions, and compared the proportion of people for whom "husband" or "wife" are suggested as a function of their profession. 

 ```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Clean the memory
rm(list=ls())

# For the report
#install.packages("rmarkdown")
library(rmarkdown, quietly=TRUE)


#===============================#
# OBTAIN AND COMBINE DATA		#
#===============================#

# Combine data for a given "category"
getdata <- function(catname){
	tmp <- read.csv(paste(catname, ".csv", sep=""), header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
	# Find duplicates
	dupl <- duplicated(tmp$V1)

	wife <- scan(paste(catname, "_wife.txt", sep=""))
	husband <- scan(paste(catname, "_husband.txt", sep=""))
	n <- length(wife) - sum(dupl)
	
	# Combine data, removing duplicates
	t1 <- cbind(tmp[!dupl,], wife=1-wife[!dupl], husband=1-husband[!dupl])
	t2 <- cbind(t1, wh=((t1$wife==1)|(t1$husband==1)), sex=1*(t1[,2]=="F")) # F=1, M=0
	names(t2)[1:3] <- c("name", "MF", "cat")
	return(t2)
}

# Do it for all our datasets
t.aaas <- getdata("aaas")
t.ted <- getdata("ted")
t.tennis <- getdata("tennis")
t.actors <- getdata("actors")
t.hhmi <- getdata("hhmi")

# Now we want to combine the Science data (ted, hhmi, aaas)
 # There are people who belong to different categories: we need to merge them
 # So first, find them
  tmpTA <- rbind(t.ted, t.aaas) # Combine TED and AAAS datasets
  duTA <- duplicated(tmpTA[, 1]) # Find replicated names
  namesTA <- tmpTA[duTA, 1] # Get the corresponding names
  #print(namesTA) # Print replicates
  tmp <- tmpTA[!duTA,] # Remove replicates

  tmpTH <- rbind(tmp, t.hhmi) # Add HHMI data
  duTH <- duplicated(tmpTH$name) # Find replicated names
  namesTH <- tmpTH[duTH, 1] # Get the corresponding names 
  #print(namesTH) # Print replicates
  tmp <- tmpTH[!duTH,] # Remove replicates

 # Now we need to add the removed info again!
  t.science <- data.frame(cbind(tmp[, c("name", "sex")], "science", tmp[, c("wife", "husband", "wh")], 1*(tmp[3]=="AAAS"), 1*(tmp[3]=="HHMI"), 1*(tmp[3]=="TED")))
  names(t.science) <- c("name", "sex", "cat", "wife", "husband", "wh", "AAAS", "HHMI", "TED")
  # Add removed AAAS data
  for (dTA in namesTA){
	t.science[t.science$name==dTA, "AAAS"] <- 1
  }
# Add removed HHMI data
  for (dTH in namesTH){
	t.science[t.science$name==dTH, "HHMI"] <- 1
  }

manualcontrol <- FALSE
if(manualcontrol){
	# Manual control of remaining potential duplicates
	library(stringr)
	# Extract last word in name (mostly last name)
	nm <- unname(vapply(t.science$name, function(l) word(l, -1), FUN.VALUE="c(1)"))
	# Sort by alphabetical order
	onm <- nm[order(nm)]
	# Sort the entire table by alphabetical order
	temp <- t.science[order(nm),]
	# Find duplicates in last names (all values, hence the | and fromLast) and print them
	temp[duplicated(onm) | duplicated(onm, fromLast=TRUE),]
	# Then inspect the table and potentially correct the files if typoes
	# But this is not necessary anymore since it's already been done.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Methods
## Data collection
### Tennis players
I downloaded on 2016-06-06 the names of the 50 best-ranked male and female tennis players (according to the [ATP](http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/rankings/singles) and [WTA](http://www.wtatennis.com/singles-rankings) rankings). [(download the list of names)](tennis.csv).

### Actors
I downloaded on 2016-06-06 a [list of the 100 most valuable movie stars](http://www.vulture.com/2012/07/most-valuable-movie-stars.html), assigned sexes based on first names and pictures. The list contains `r sum(t.actors$sex)` women names and `r sum(1-t.actors$sex)` men names. [(download the list of names)](actors.csv).

### Scientists
I downloaded on 2016-06-06 three datasets: 

- The names of all AAAS members in the [Evolutionary and Population Biology and Ecology section](https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/classlist.pdf) (`r sum(t.aaas$sex)` women, `r sum(1-t.aaas$sex)` men, [download the list of names](aaas.csv).);

- The names of all [HHMI scientists](https://www.hhmi.org/scientists/browse?kw=&sort_by=field_scientist_last_name&sort_order=ASC&items_per_page=100) (`r sum(t.hhmi$sex)` women, `r sum(1-t.hhmi$sex)` men, [download the list of names](hhmi.csv).);

- The names of all TED speakers in the [Science section](https://www.ted.com/talks?sort=popular&topics%5B%5D=science&language=en) (`r sum(t.ted$sex)` women, `r sum(1-t.ted$sex)` men, [download the list of names](ted.csv).).

Some names appear in more than one of these lists. I combined all names in a table, removed duplicates, and indicated with 0s and 1s the affiliations of each scientist, e.g.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.science[t.science$name=="Edward O. Wilson", ]
```
